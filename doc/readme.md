The file "Explanation.pdf" is the somewhat annotated version originally 
written by: http://www.mathertel.de/Arduino/RotaryEncoderLibrary.aspx

"Rotary Encoder.pdf" is a good explanation about the inner workings of 
a rotary encoder.

What puzzled me for a while was:
1.  When rotating the rorary encoder you feel on every STEP a little notch.
    This is the detent.
2.  Between each and every detent there are 4 [four] states.
3.  The states are "constructed" by the voltage on the pins DT and CLK.
